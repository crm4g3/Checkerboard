CheckerBoard Retrospective

1. I struggled only a little for this challenge. My solution was not the same and did not work as well as the posted solution.

2. I understood most of the programming concepts during this challenge.

3. I met most of the challenges requirements. Only exception being that my board would not fit the scene correctly at times.

4. My solution is similar except for the smoothness at which it changes as it is being resized and how it fits in the scene.

5. I would like to know why my listeners were slower to respond when resizing. I could use some more time going over listeners
